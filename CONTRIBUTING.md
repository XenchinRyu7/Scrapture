- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps
- **Describe the behavior you observed** and what behavior you expected to see
- **Include screenshots or animated GIFs** if possible

- **Provide a detailed description** of the suggested enhancement
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users
- **List some examples** of how the enhancement would be used

### Pull Requests

Please follow these steps for pull requests:

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following our style guidelines
3. **Test your changes** thoroughly
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Ensure the test suite passes**
6. **Make sure your code lints** without errors
7. **Write a clear commit message**

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XenchinRyu7/Scrapture.git
   cd Scrapture
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:push
   npm run db:generate
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run the worker (optional):**
   ```bash
   npm run worker
   # or
   npm run worker:session
   ```

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

**Examples:**
```
feat: Add support for structured data extraction
fix: Resolve memory leak in crawler worker
docs: Update README with Docker instructions
style: Format code with Prettier
refactor: Simplify URL normalization logic
test: Add unit tests for robots parser
chore: Update dependencies
```

### TypeScript Style Guide

- **Use TypeScript** for all new code
- **Avoid `any` types** - use proper typing or `unknown`
- **Use functional components** with hooks in React
- **Follow ESLint rules** configured in the project
- **Write meaningful variable and function names**
- **Add JSDoc comments** for public APIs
- **Use async/await** instead of callbacks

**Example:**
```typescript
/**
 * Crawls a webpage and extracts structured data
 * @param url - The URL to crawl
 * @param options - Crawling options
 * @returns Promise with crawled data
 */
async function crawlPage(
  url: string,
  options: CrawlOptions
): Promise<CrawlResult> {
  // Implementation
}
```
